					   <h3>Computer Science - Aviation - Leadership</h3>
					   <p>My name is Michael Bachand Jr. I'm a student at the CREC Academy of Aerospace 
					   	  and Engineering in Windsor Connecticut, a BSA Senior Patrol Leader, and a Cadet 
						  First Lieutenant in the Civil Air Patrol where I serve as the Cadet Commander of the 
						  186th Composite Squadron located in Plainville Connecticut, as the Vice Chair of the 
						  Connecticut Wing Cadet Advisory Council, and as the Vice Chair for the North East
						  Region Strategic Communications Coordination Commitee.</p>
					   <p>In school, I am currently working on the planning of a fully enclosed cockpit flight
					      simulator that will eventually be used by the school to introduce students to the feeling
						  of being inside of - and flying - an airplane. I will be preforming this project as an
						  independent study and will hopefully have the simulator finished and working by 
						  January of 2018.</p>
