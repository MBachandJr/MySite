					   <h3>Michael William Bachand Jr.</h3>
					   <p>My name is Michael Bachand Jr. I'm a student at the CREC Academy of Aerospace 
					   	  and Engineering in Windsor Connecticut, a BSA Senior Patrol Leader, and a Cadet 
						  First Lieutenant in the Civil Air Patrol where I serve as the Cadet Commander of the 
						  186th Composite Squadron located in Plainville Connecticut, as the Vice Chair of the 
						  Connecticut Wing Cadet Advisory Council, and as the Vice Chair for the North East
						  Region Strategic Communications Coordination Commitee.</p>
					   <p>In school, I am currently working on the planning of a fully enclosed cockpit flight
					      simulator that will eventually be used by the school to introduce students to the feeling
						  of being inside of - and flying - an airplane. I will be preforming this project as an
						  independent study and will hopefully have the simulator finished and working by 
						  January of 2018.</p>   
					   <p>I really like participating in extracurricular activities and although not many of them
					   	  are done through my school, I like to participate within my community. I work with the 
						  CAP to set up security/parking details at a lot of community events, and also work with
						  my church to assist at fairs, parades, and other community events around Bristol CT. I 
						  also volunteer at the Bristol Public Pools as a Water Safety Instructor Aide, and work
						  with my church, serving at the Zion Lutheran Soup Kitchen in Bristol. I currently work as
						  a lifeguard for the Wheeler YMCA in Plainville CT.</p>
					   <p>In the future, I hope to earn an Air Force ROTC Scholarship and commision in the United 
					      States Air Force. I hope to major in either Aerospace Engineering or Computer Science and
						  hope to be able to persue either one of those careers or an Aviation career in the U.S.
						  Air Force.
